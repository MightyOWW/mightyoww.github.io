* Hello, I’m Xiaohang!
<br>
* I am a undergraduate student at the Shanghai Jiaotong University (SJTU), Shanghai, majoring in Computer and Information Engineering. Currently, I am doing research about 3D reconstruction supervised by [Prof. Xiaoguang Han](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/hanxiaoguang) in the [GAP Lab](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/hanxiaoguang/). I am also looking for SDE intern opportunities in Çhina.
<br>
* I was a CS master student at the University of Southern California (USC). Sadly, I didn't obtain my degree because of [P.P. 10043](https://www.10043.org/).
<br>
* Before that, I was a 2+2 student of Australian National University (ANU) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU). I have been awarded the degree of Bachelor of Advanced Computing with First Class Honours from ANU and the degree of Bachelor of Engineering in Software Engineering from NPU in July 2020. My honours project is Multi-view Detection for Densely Occluded Pedestrian supervised by [Dr Liang Zheng](http://www.liangzheng.com.cn/) in ANU.
<br>
* I started learning computer programming when I was a junior middle school student. I like programming! I am proficient with C++, Python and Pascal. I have used them to take many programming contests. I can also use Matlab, Java and R by doing some course works.
<br>
* My research interest is in Software Engineering (SE) and Computer Vision (CV). 
<br>
* I had internship experience in Hulu, Meituan, IDEA and so on. I like full-stack development, focusing more on the back end.
<br>
* To learn more about me, you can have a view of my CV page [here](/cv), or download my resume here: [English version](/files/resume_en.pdf) or [Chinese version](/files/resume_cn.pdf).
<br>
* I like writing blogs to summarize the knowledge or record my interesting experiments. I like sharing and discussing things with others. Visit my Chinese blog [here](https://blog.djinguo.com)!
